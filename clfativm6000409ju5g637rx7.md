If you are as excited as I am, then you probably have been expecting the arrival of GPT-4 as well. It was less than 1 year ago when OpenAI opened access to the most advanced chatbot called chatgpt, The AI with about 175,000,000 parameters is capable of generating human-like text with almost 100% accuracy, able to write codes, writes documents, communicating and answering questions faster and better than a google search.

This has put a lot of people in fear that their job will be replaced by AI very soon. OpenAI also announced that they were working on another version of AI known as GPT-4 and it would have over 100,000,000,000(100 billion) parameters. This would mean that it would have more than 10 times the current capacity of GPT-3.

Less than 48hours ago, OpenAi finally launched GPT-4 and this post will give you 10 awesome abilities of GPT-4:

1. Generate Codes: unlike GPT-3, GPT-4 can generate more larger and accurate codes and can handle 25K input words. You can just simply tell it "Generate a python code for todo app" and it will. Not only that, but it can also be your best debug partner.
    
2. Create websites from mockup: This is one amazing ability that makes GPT-4 so awesome.

    It can take a picture of a website mockup then write the entire code for it. Isn't that amazing?
    
3. Build working video games: The ability for it to create an entire game from scratch in any language makes it so super scary. You can tell it to write you a game of pong or even a snake game or to beat it all, tell it to write you a 3d video game.
    
4. Generate meaning from images: If you ever come across an image or photo in which you arent sure whats going on in it, give it to GPT-4 and it will explain and tell you what the image is all about.
    
5. Prepare and ace exams: With GPT-4, you can prepare and even ace you exams with ease

    In Conclusion, we are seeing a surge of growth in AI than ever before and I don't know if this can be considered AGI(Artificial General Intelligence) but what I do know is that like every other tool out there. We need to see GPT-4 as a tool rather than some villain that has come to take over our jobs. Learn to use and utilize it ability to be better and smarter.
